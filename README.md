This is a collection of vocabulary words, phrases and conjugations I gether from various public domain sources back in the mid-80s. I used them in the original LookListenLearn.org under the title "My Language Coach".

Sometime after the turn of (this) century, AT&T developed a very nice voice synthesizer tiles "Natural Voices", in several languages. They had a public site showcasing the software, and allowed people to submit sample text to be coverted to an mp3 of the voice. I tested it for: A. script access (what we would call a bot today) and frequency. They had no filters, so I used the data from the language files I already had and grabbed audio for all the words and phrases I had at the time. They've since put filters on their public site, so scraping it would be impossible. But I still have the audio. Some of the letters have been altered based on what encoding was available in whatever computer I migrated the files from and to, but they are consistent enough to predict in scripting. I used them on the site then and have them available 20 years later to use as I revamp the site.

In the audio folder are four .data files containing a list of the audio files in that folder. This helps to quickly determine the presence of the files rather than looping through a remote access to determine if the file exists.
