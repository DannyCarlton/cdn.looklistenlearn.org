### [/languages](/cdn.looklistenlearn.org/languages) 
This is a collection of vocabulary words, phrases and conjugations I gether from various public domain sources back in the mid-80s. I used them in the original LookListenLearn.org under the title "My Language Coach".

### /audio  
Sometime in the 90s AT&T developed a very nice voice synthesizer, in several languages. They had a publc site showcasing the software, and allowed people to submit sampel text to be covernted to an mp3 of the voice. I tested it for, A. script (what we would call a bot today) access and frequency. They had no filters, so I used the data from the langauge files I alreayd had and grabbed audio for all the words and phrases I had at the time. Thye've since put filters on their public site, so scraping it would be impossible. But I still have the audio. Some of the letters have been altered based on what encoding was available in whatever computer I migrated the files from and to, but they are consistent enough to predict in scripting.
